## Introduction

The Cofinity-X system relies on a well-defined context schema to ensure accurate and meaningful interactions with users. This schema outlines the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. By maintaining a clear and standardized context schema, we can achieve a higher level of accuracy in understanding and responding to user queries.


## Context Schemas

An overview of the given Schemas and Credentials in this Registry.


### W3C verifiable credential schema
 This is a clone schema from https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2
 We added to avoid any production issue if w3c changes schema without any prior notice.

### W3C BitstringStatusList credential schema
The BitstringStatusList schema contains properties which are using in revocable verifiable credential and status list credentials.

ref: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/

We host this schema at Cofinity-X side to avoid any production issue if w3c changes schema without any prior notification
